11-Dispatch
Dispatch is the service which dispatches the product after purchase. It is written in GoLang, So wanted to install GoLang.

Hint
Developer has chosen GoLang, Check with developer which version of GoLang is needed.

Install GoLang

dnf install golang -y

Configure the application.

info
Our application developed by the developer of our org and it is not having any RPM software just like other softwares. So we need to configure every step manually

Recap
We already discussed in Linux basics section that applications should run as nonroot user.

Add application User

useradd roboshop

info
User roboshop is a function / daemon user to run the application. Apart from that we dont use this user to login to server.

Also, username roboshop has been picked because it more suits to our project name.

info
We keep application in one standard location. This is a usual practice that runs in the organization.

Lets setup an app directory.

mkdir /app 

Download the application code to created app directory.

curl -L -o /tmp/dispatch.zip https://roboshop-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/dispatch-v3.zip 
cd /app 
unzip /tmp/dispatch.zip

Every application is developed by development team will have some common softwares that they use as libraries. This application also have the same way of defined dependencies in the application configuration.

Lets download the dependencies & build the software.

cd /app 
go mod init dispatch
go get 
go build

We need to setup a new service in systemd so systemctl can manage this service

info
We already discussed in linux basics that advantages of systemctl managing services, Hence we are taking that approach. Which is also a standard way in the OS.

Setup SystemD Payment Service

/etc/systemd/system/dispatch.service
[Unit]
Description = Dispatch Service
[Service]
User=roboshop
Environment=AMQP_HOST=RABBITMQ-IP
Environment=AMQP_USER=roboshop
Environment=AMQP_PASS=roboshop123
ExecStart=/app/dispatch
SyslogIdentifier=dispatch

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

info
Hint! You can create file by using vim /etc/systemd/system/dispatch.service

Load the service.

systemctl daemon-reload

info
This above command is because we added a new service, We are telling systemd to reload so it will detect new service.

Start the service.

systemctl enable dispatch 
systemctl start dispatch
