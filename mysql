07-MySQL
Developer has chosen the database MySQL. Hence, we are trying to install it up and configure it.

Hint
Versions of the DB Software you will get context from the developer, Meaning we need to check with developer. Developer has shared the version information as MySQL-8.x

Install MySQL Server

dnf install mysql-server -y

Start MySQL Service

systemctl enable mysqld
systemctl start mysqld  

Next, We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service. Use password RoboShop@1 or any other as per your choice.

mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass RoboShop@1
