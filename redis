04-Redis
Redis is used for in-memory data storage(Caching) and allows users to access the data of database over API.

Hint
Versions of the DB Software you will get context from the developer, Meaning we need to check with developer.

Install redis, By default redis 6 is available, We would like to enable 7 version and install list.

dnf module disable redis -y
dnf module enable redis:7 -y

Install Redis

dnf install redis -y 

Usually Redis opens the port only to localhost(127.0.0.1), meaning this service can be accessed by the application that is hosted on this server only. However, we need to access this service to be accessed by another server, So we need to change the config accordingly.

Update listen address from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 in /etc/redis/redis.conf

Update protected-mode from yes to no in /etc/redis/redis.conf

Tip
You can edit file by using vim /etc/redis/redis.conf

Start & Enable Redis Service

systemctl enable redis 
systemctl start redis
